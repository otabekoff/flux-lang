# Variables & Types

Flux is explicitly typed — every variable, parameter, and return value has a stated type.

## Let Bindings (Immutable)

```flux
let name: String = "Alice";
let age: Int32 = 30;
let pi: Float64 = 3.14159;
let active: Bool = true;
```

Immutable bindings cannot be reassigned:

```flux
let x: Int32 = 10;
// x = 20;  // ERROR: cannot assign to immutable binding
```

## Mutable Bindings

Use `mut` for mutable variables:

```flux
let mut counter: Int32 = 0;
counter = counter + 1;  // OK
```

## Constants

Compile-time constants use `const`:

```flux
const MAX_SIZE: Int32 = 1024;
const PI: Float64 = 3.14159265358979;
```

## Built-in Types

### Integers

| Type      | Size     | Range                   |
| --------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| `Int8`    | 8-bit    | -128 to 127             |
| `Int16`   | 16-bit   | -32,768 to 32,767       |
| `Int32`   | 32-bit   | -2³¹ to 2³¹-1           |
| `Int64`   | 64-bit   | -2⁶³ to 2⁶³-1           |
| `Int128`  | 128-bit  | -2¹²⁷ to 2¹²⁷-1         |
| `UInt8`   | 8-bit    | 0 to 255                |
| `UInt16`  | 16-bit   | 0 to 65,535             |
| `UInt32`  | 32-bit   | 0 to 2³²-1              |
| `UInt64`  | 64-bit   | 0 to 2⁶⁴-1              |
| `UInt128` | 128-bit  | 0 to 2¹²⁸-1             |
| `IntPtr`  | Platform | Pointer size (signed)   |
| `UIntPtr` | Platform | Pointer size (unsigned) |

### Floating Point

| Type      | Size   | Precision  |
| --------- | ------ | ---------- |
| `Float32` | 32-bit | ~7 digits  |
| `Float64` | 64-bit | ~15 digits |

### Other Primitives

| Type     | Description                 |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| `Bool`   | `true` or `false`           |
| `Char`   | Unicode scalar value        |
| `String` | UTF-8 string                |
| `Void`   | No value (unit type)        |
| `Never`  | Never returns (bottom type) |

## Integer Literals

```flux
let decimal: Int32 = 1_000_000;
let hex: Int32 = 0xFF;
let binary: Int32 = 0b1010_0011;
let octal: Int32 = 0o77;
```

## Type Casting

Explicit casting with `as`:

```flux
let x: Int32 = 42;
let y: Float64 = x as Float64;
let z: Int64 = x as Int64;
```

No implicit conversions exist in Flux — every type conversion must be explicit.

## Type Aliases

You can create an alias for an existing type using the `type` keyword:

```flux
type UserId = Int32;
type EmailAddress = String;

let id: UserId = 12345;
let email: EmailAddress = "user@example.com";
```

Type aliases are just names; they are not distinct types for type checking purposes.

## Reference Types

Flux supports both immutable and mutable references:

- Immutable reference: `&T`
- Mutable reference: `&mut T`

Example:

```flux
let x: Int32 = 42;
let y: &Int32 = &x;        // Immutable reference
let z: &mut Int32 = &mut x; // Mutable reference
```

See [Reference Types](/reference/types) for details.
