    details: Every type is stated, every allocation is visible. Flux enforces clarity — no implicit conversions, no hidden copies.
    icon: 🎯
  - title: Ownership & Borrowing
    details: Memory safety without a garbage collector. Move semantics, immutable & mutable borrows, and deterministic drop.

  - title: Traits & Generics
    details: Powerful trait-based polymorphism with monomorphized generics and where clauses for precise constraints.
    icon: 🧩
