# Conventional commits

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to generate changelogs and release notes.

- Commits should be prefixed with the type of change (feat, fix, docs, etc.).
- Commits should be written in present tense.

After each successful task completion, you should run `git add .` and `git commit` to generate a new commit.
