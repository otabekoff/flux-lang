# Implementation Rules

- Do not skip tasks.
- Do not leave unfinished or broken code.
- Do not postpone required changes.
- Do not simplify tests just to make them pass.
- Tests define the correct behavior.
- Don't escape from big changes.

If a task requires:

- Refactoring
- Large architectural changes
- Multiple steps

Then:

- Perform the changes immediately.
- If too large, break into smaller steps but make sure to do completely end-to-end.
- Complete all steps end-to-end before marking the task done.

So you are free to:

- Add
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete
- Edit
- Upgrade
- Fix
- Bug fix
- Implement
- Make changes
- Remove
- Insert
- Do
